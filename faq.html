      <p><strong class="text-white">What is Peel?</strong><br>
      Peel is a Chrome extension that compares prices across stores and retailers to show you similar deals while you shop online.</p>

      <p><strong class="text-white">Is Peel free?</strong><br>
      Yes! Peel is 100% free to install and use.</p>

      <div>
        <p class="text-white font-semibold">How does Peel make money?</p>
        <p>Peel uses affiliate links where available. If you purchase a product through our extension, we may earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. Unlike other current shopping savings extensions, Peel is committed to transparency and putting users first. We will never take credit in cases we can't find anything for you.</p>
      </div>

      <p><strong class="text-white">Which sites does Peel work on?</strong><br>
      Peel currently works best with major retailers such as Amazon, Walmart, eBay, Target, and Best Buy. As you shop, we'll find similar deals and lower priced alternatives from other sites. Additional stores and retailers are planned for the future.</p>

      <div>
        <p class="text-white font-semibold">What browsers does Peel work on?</p>
        <p>Currently, Peel is available as a Chrome extension exclusively. Support for additional browsers like Firefox, Edge, and Safari are coming soon.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="text-white font-semibold">Does Peel work outside the US?</p>
        <p>Peel is primarily designed for US-based stores and pricing. While it may still appear on international product pages, deal comparisons and availability are most accurate for users in the United States. That said, we hope to expand our extension internationally in the near future. </p>

      <div id="referral">
        <p class="text-white font-semibold">How does the $10 referral cashback work?</p>
        <p>
          After you make your first purchase using Peel, you'll unlock access to a personal referral link.
          Share it with friends and when <strong>3 people install Peel and complete a purchase</strong> using your link,
          you'll earn <strong>$10 cashback</strong> as a thank you.  
          <br><br>
          To receive your reward, weâ€™ll ask for your <strong>PayPal email</strong> after you're eligible.
          Your info is used only for payout and never stored or shared beyond that purpose.
        </p>
      </div>           

      <p><strong class="text-white">Does Peel track my data?</strong><br>
      No. Peel does not collect any personal data or browsing history. It only sends product info needed to generate deal comparisons.</p>
