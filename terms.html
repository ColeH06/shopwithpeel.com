        Welcome to Peel. By using the Peel browser extension ("Peel", "we", "our", or "us"), you agree to the following terms and conditions. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not use the extension.
      </p>

      <p><strong class="text-white">1. Overview</strong><br>
      Peel is a browser extension designed to help users discover lower prices and deals on other platforms when you shop online. It provides a comparative experience by finding the product you're viewing for a lower price on other sites.
      </p>

      <p><strong class="text-white">2. Platform Scope and Limitations</strong><br>
      Peel does not search for products or compare prices across all stores or retailers, though we are actively expanding and integrating more.
      </p>

      <p><strong class="text-white">3. Accuracy and Reliability</strong><br>
      Due to limitations in product data, naming conventions, and listing inconsistencies, Peel cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or relevance of its comparisons. Results may include but are not limited to:<br>

      - Mismatches in pricing<br>

      - Mismatches in products or product variants (e.g., size, color, model)<br>

      - Listings that may not include key components or accessories
      </p>

      <p>We strongly encourage users to review listings carefully before making any purchasing decisions.</p>

      <p><strong class="text-white">4. Affiliate Disclosure</strong><br>
      Peel uses affiliate links when available. We may earn a small commission on clicks and/or qualifying purchases from our partnered merchants to support development at no additional cost to the user.
      </p>
      
        <p><strong class="text-white">5. Privacy and Data</strong><br>
          Peel respects user privacy and does not collect personal data. The extension only sends product titles or page metadata to our server to generate relevant comparisons. No browsing history or user identity is stored.
          </p>
          <p>                        

      <p><strong class="text-white">6. Liability</strong><br>
      We are not responsible for any purchases made as a result of using Peel. All transactions are handled by third-party platforms (e.g., eBay), and users are subject to those platforms' terms and conditions.
      </p>

      <p><strong class="text-white">7. Changes to Terms</strong><br>
      These terms may be updated from time to time. Continued use of Peel after any changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.
      </p>

      <p><strong class="text-white">8. Contact</strong><br>
      For support or questions, please reach out to contact.shopwithpeel@gmail.com.

      <p>By using Peel, you acknowledge and agree to these terms.</p>
