        Welcome to Peel. By using the Peel browser extension ("Peel", "we", "our", or "us"), you agree to the following terms and conditions. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not use the extension.
      </p>

      <p><strong class="text-white">1. Overview</strong><br>
      Peel is a browser extension designed to help users discover lower prices, deals, and similar products on other platforms. It provides a comparative experience between a product you're currently viewing and alternatives found on third-party platforms.
      </p>

      <p><strong class="text-white">2. Platform Scope and Limitations</strong><br>
      Peel does not search for products or compare prices across all stores or retailers, though we are actively expanding and integrating more.
      </p>

      <p><strong class="text-white">3. Accuracy and Reliability</strong><br>
      Due to limitations in product data, naming conventions, and listing inconsistencies, Peel cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or relevance of its comparisons. Results may include but are not limited to:<br>

      - Mismatches in pricing<br>

      - Mismatches in products or product variants (e.g., size, color, model)<br>

      - Listings that may not include key components or accessories
      </p>

      <p>We strongly encourage users to review listings carefully before making any purchasing decisions. Peel is a tool meant to assist in product discovery and suggest alternatives, NOT a definitive product matching engine.</p>

      <p><strong class="text-white">4. Affiliate Disclosure</strong><br>
      Peel uses affiliate links where available. We may earn a commission on qualifying purchases to support development at no additional cost to the user.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong id="cashback" class="text-white">5. Cashback & Referral Program</strong><br>
        Peel may offer limited-time promotional rewards, such as cashback for referring friends who make qualifying purchases through the Peel extension.
      </p>
      <p>By participating, you agree to the following terms:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 mb-2 space-y-1 text-[15.5px]">
        <li>To be eligible, you must make at least one purchase through Peel prior to referring others.</li>
        <li>Referred friends must make a minimum $50 purchase through Peel using a link we provide.</li>
        <li>Referred purchases must be made within 24 hours of clicking a Peel affiliate link for the purchase to be eligible.</li>
        <li>Cashback is rewarded only after three eligible referrals have completed valid purchases.</li>
        <li>Users can earn $5 cashback for every three friends who install the extension and complete valid qualifying purchases. This reward is repeatable with no fixed cap, provided all referral and purchase conditions are met.</li>
        <li>Peel reserves the right to verify purchase legitimacy and suspend users if fraudulent activity is detected, including but not limited to self-referrals, use of duplicate accounts, or abuse of the system.</li>
        <li>Users must provide a valid PayPal email address or Venmo username to receive payment.</li>
        <li>Payouts are processed within 15â€“30 days after qualifying purchases are confirmed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Peel may update or discontinue the program at any time without notice.</p>
      
        <p><strong class="text-white">6. Privacy and Data</strong><br>
          Peel respects user privacy and does not collect personal data. The extension only sends product titles or page metadata to our server to generate relevant comparisons. No browsing history or user identity is stored.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you participate in cashback or referral programs, we may collect your PayPal email address or Venmo username solely for the purpose of issuing payments. This information is stored securely, used only for payout processing, and never shared.

      These terms may be updated from time to time. Continued use of Peel after any changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.
