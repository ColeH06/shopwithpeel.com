        Welcome to Peel. By using the Peel browser extension ("Peel", "we", "our", or "us"), you agree to the following terms and conditions. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not use the extension.
      </p>
      1. Overview

Peel is a browser extension designed to help users identify lower-priced or similar products on other platforms. It provides a comparative experience between a product you're currently viewing and listings found on third-party platforms.

2. Platform Scope and Limitations

Peel is currently in beta. At this stage, Peel compares product listings exclusively on eBay. It does not search or compare prices across other retailers at this time, though integrations with additional retailers are planned for the future.

Peel's eBay comparison functionality is designed to work when browsing major shopping sites, including Amazon, Walmart, Target, and Best Buy, among others. However, results may not always reflect exact product matches or accurate alternatives.

3. Accuracy and Reliability

Due to limitations in product data, naming conventions, and listing inconsistencies, Peel cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or relevance of its comparisons. Results may include but not limited to:

Similar but not identical items

Mismatches in pricing

Mismatches in product variants (e.g., size, color, model)

Listings that may not include key components or accessories

We strongly encourage users to review eBay listings carefully before making any purchasing decisions. Peel is a tool meant to assist in product discovery, not a definitive shopping recommendation engine.

4. Affiliate Disclosure

Peel uses affiliate links where available. As an eBay affiliate, we may earn a commission on qualifying purchases at no additional cost to the user.

5. Privacy and Data

Peel respects user privacy and does not collect personally identifiable information. The extension may send product titles or page metadata to our server to generate relevant comparisons. No browsing history or user identity is stored.

6. Liability

We are not responsible for any purchases made as a result of using Peel. All transactions are handled by third-party platforms (e.g., eBay), and users are subject to those platforms' terms and conditions.

7. Changes to Terms

These terms may be updated from time to time. Continued use of Peel after any changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.
