        Peel does not collect personal information during normal use. Peel may analyze product titles, page URLs, and structured product data to improve deal discovery.
        </p>
        <p>
        However, for users who qualify for cashback payouts, we may collect a valid PayPal email address solely for the purpose of delivering rewards. Submission of this information is at user discretion and only required if a payout is requested.
        </p>        

      <p><strong class="text-white">2. Use of Data</strong><br>
      Product information collected from pages is used only to find relevant deal matches from our integrated retailers. We do not sell your data or use it for behavioral advertising.
      </p>

      <p><strong class="text-white">3. Cookies & Tracking</strong><br>
      Peel itself does not use tracking cookies. However, retailers and stores may apply their own tracking mechanisms when you visit or purchase through their sites. Peel is not responsible for third-party tracking practices.
      </p>

      <p><strong class="text-white">4. Cashback Data</strong><br>
        PayPal email addresses submitted for cashback rewards are stored securely and used exclusively to process reward payments. We do not share, sell, or use this information for marketing or behavioral tracking. You may contact us at any time to request deletion of your payment details.
